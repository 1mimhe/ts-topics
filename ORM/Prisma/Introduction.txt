The Prisma schema allows developers to define their application models in an intuitive data modeling language (.prisma).

Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder
that is tailored specifically to your database schema.

Generate => npm install @prisma/client => prisma generate
then import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

After you change your data model, you'll need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to ensure the client gets updated.
