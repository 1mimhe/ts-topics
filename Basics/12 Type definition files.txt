'.d.ts' files:
.d.ts files are declaration files that contain only type information. These files donâ€™t produce .js outputs; they are only used for typechecking.

TypeScript includes declaration files for all of the standardized built-in APIs available in JavaScript runtimes.

# For non-built-in APIs, there are a variety of ways you can get declaration files:
## DefinitelyTyped / @types:
	The DefinitelyTyped repository is a centralized repo storing declaration files for thousands of 	libraries. The vast majority of commonly-used libraries have declaration files available on 	DefinitelyTyped.
	=> npm i @types/{library-name}
## Bundled Types:
	TypeScript is able to automatically resolve the types for you.
